                        <h4><strong>ISSUE: NON WORKING CODE/CODE ERROR</strong></h4>
                        <p>If you receive a code which is not working for the IMEI you provided then the first thing you should do is Verify the code. In order to do this you will need to proceed
                            to your codes page where the codes are and right near where your unlock code is listed will be a button which says &ldquo;Verify&rdquo;. This will request the server to double
                            check the code provided in order to assure it is correct, if it is not or if another code is available then a new code will be provided for you. If the verified code still does 
                            not work then please see instructions below:Our company policy dictates that if your current code supplied is not working for the IMEI and information you&rsquo;ve provided then
                            we can refund you, all you need to do is provide us with video proof. in the video you will need to display two things:
                        <ol type ="1)">
                            <li>The IMEI on the screen of the phone (so we know youre working with the same phone)</li>
                            <li> You inputting the exact code weve provided properly into the phone and the message the phone replies.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p>Like you we are required to pay for these codes so once we receive this video i will forward it to
                            our supplier and once he refunds us, we can then refund you. Like you we are also required to pay for these codes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Please note: If you have misordered the code (given us incorrect information, ex: IMEI, make, model, country, network) then you will not be refunded for the purchase.
                        </p>

                        <h4><strong>ISSUE: BLACKBERRY OLD SECURITY CODE NOT WORKING</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            The issue is that due to the fact the phone you have is a newer model, the only carrier able to unlock it would be Blackberry New Security (Worldwide). So please order through your
                            account using that carrier, please keep in mind that New Security codes do cost more then Old Security, however if the price is too high for you just let us know and we&rsquo;ll 
                            see what we can do. Also, once you order the code through New Security we will refund your account for the Old security code. Just email us once you&rsquo;ve done so.
                        </p>

                        <h4><strong>ISSUE: SAMSUNG UNFREEZE REQUEST</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately we are unable to provide Unfreeze codes at this time for SAMSUNG models, there is no current 
                            solution available. If one does arise we will notify you, be sure to keep an eye on our Latest News 
                            in your account.ISSUE:&nbsp;
                        </p>

                        <h4><strong>PRICE ADJUSTMENT REQUEST</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            In the EXTREMELY RARE event that you are offered lower pricing elsewhere please send us an email with screenshots or log in information from the alternative supplier and we will
                            have our price adjustment team take a look to verify the rates.
                        </p>

                        <h4><strong>ISSUE: LARGE QUANTITY ORDER</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            Please Email us with the carrier and quantity you&rsquo;re looking to purchase and a specialist will reply to you with a quote.
                        </p>
                        <h4><strong>ISSUE: PAYMENT MADE BUT NOT SHOWING UP IN YOUR ACCOUNT</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            If you made a standard payment (Credit Card, or PayPal Standard Pay) and it doesn&rsquo;t show up in your account right away,
                            don&rsquo;t get nervous as this is normal, sometimes it takes a few minutes for the payment to apply to your account. 
                            However if you paid using an e-Check (no funds in your Paypal account so they are being pulled from your bank) then the payment will not
                            appear until the funds come through from your bank, this usually takes between 1-3 business days to complete. Once delivered the funds will appear
                            in your account. If you made a PayPal Masspayment then there will be a slight delay, representatives are standing by to apply your 
                            MassPayments so the wait shouldn&rsquo;t be too long.
                        </p>

                        <h4><strong>ISSUE: CANCEL OUT AN ORDER</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            In order to cancel out an already existing order, you will need to click the cancel button on the codes page located near that 
                            specific IMEI. Each provider for each unlock method has their own cancellation policy. Once selected the request will be in a 
                            pending status which means it is not yet cancelled. It will reflect a status of either Cancelled or Not Cancelled shortly thereafter 
                            depending on whether or not the supplier has begun to process the code. We advise you to please wait until you receive this notification 
                            before you refund your customers because if the supplier has already begun to process the codes then your request will be rejected and you
                            will not be refunded.&nbsp;
                        </p>
